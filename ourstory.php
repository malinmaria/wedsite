<h1> Our Story </h1>
<article class="boxed">
  <p7>
  It all started in August 2007 when we met on my first day of cross country practice at Youngstown State University. We didn't talk much at first but we still bonded over trying to get through
  gruling Gorby workouts. We got a lot closer during my second year on the team, he asked for my number and we started talking all the time. Things just clicked with us, he was so easy to talk to 
  and we had so much fun together. We officially started dating on March 7, 2009. So many things happened in the next five years. We graduated college together and are still continuing our education.
  We moved around to different places, we lived in DC for a summer and then to Pittsburgh for the next year and now we are living in and loving Charleson, SC.
