<h1> The Proposal Story </h1>

<article class="boxed">
<p7>
Thursday morning December 19th, Dan promised he'd take me to breakfast early before we both went to work for the day. I agreed and thought it would be a great way to start the day but he didn't tell me where we were going to eat. We started heading in the direction of the beach near our apartment so I thought we were going to eat somewhere around there. But we didn't park near any restaurants, we parked near a beach entrance. We got out of the car and started heading onto the beach. The sun still hadn't come up yet so there was a nice morning glow. I was excited because we had never seen the sun rise on the beach even though we'd heard Isle of Palms has the most beautiful sunrises. So I whipped out my camera and started snapping a bunch of pictures as the sun started to rise just above the ocean. I finally put my camera away and was enjoying the view with Dan by my side. Then I was ready to get going to breakfast but Dan didn't seem to want to move. After a few more minutes Dan turned to face me, got down on his knee and was holding a ring in his hand and asked me to marry him! It was so beautiful and unexpected! Needless to say, I did eventually get my breakfast and we called off work for the day. &hearts;
